By nature, cool air rushes to the warm zone, thereby creating what we call wind. There are different ranges of wind, all indicative of their strength and direction. The Beaufort Wind Force Scale outlines the various wind strengths from a calm force 0 (less than 1 mph) to a hurricane-level force 12 (73+ mph). The Beaufort scale describes force 8 to be what’s called a fresh gale of wind, blowing at 39-46 mph. This is when you’ll start to see pieces of trees breaking and blowing around. A strong gale of wind blows at 47-54 mph and becomes a bigger threat to your home, particularly the shingles on your roof.
